# Voluntary Association
This repository contains the source code for the official website of our volunteer organization. The project includes both a public-facing section and an internal management dashboard.
- The public section provides information about our mission, ongoing projects, volunteering opportunities, events, and how to get involved or donate.
- The admin/management section is a restricted area used by staff and volunteers to manage activities, members, event registrations, and other organizational tasks.
